It's important to practice basics in isolation first, without being confused by more advanced topics. You need to learn new topics, then practice them in isolation, then learn new topics, and repeat. After a certain amount of practice, you will then be ready to learn in context with a project.

You may not understand the impact of each exercise, but over time, you'll see results and you'll be able to perform better when you work on more complicated programs.

We won't be running Rubocop on code in this lesson, because they're pretty small and contained. We want to focus on learning to problem solve and debugging.
